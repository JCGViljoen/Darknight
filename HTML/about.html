        <p class="batman"><b>In the name of his murdered parents, Bruce Wayne wages eternal war on the criminals of Gotham City. He is vengeance. He is the night. He is Batman.
            Batman has dedicated his life to an endless crusade, a war on all criminals in the name of his murdered parents, who were taken from him when he was just a child.
            Since that tragic night, he has trained his body and mind to near physical perfection to be a self-made Super Hero. 
            He's developed an arsenal of technology that would put most armies to shame.
            And he's assembled teams of his fellow DC Super Heroes, like the Justice League, the Outsiders and Batman, Incorporated.A playboy billionaire by day, Bruce Wayne's double life affords him the comfort of a life without financial worry, a loyal butler-turned-guardian and the perfect base of operations in the ancient network of caves beneath his family's sprawling estate. By night, however, he sheds all pretense, dons his iconic scalloped cape and pointed cowl and takes to the shadowy streets, skies and rooftops of Gotham City.</b>

        <h2>Red Hood</h2>

        <p class="Red_Hood"><b>Former Robin Jason Todd parted ways with the Batman over their vastly different approaches to crimefighting, eventually founding his own team, the Outlaws.
            Death can be a strange thing for superheroes, especially when it doesn't quite stick. Just ask Jason Todd. As Batman's second Robin, Jason died at the hands of the Joker when he was just a child. But he returned to life with the help of a Lazarus Pit and the literal warping of time and reality.
            Unfortunately, Jason's resurrection was far from a pleasant one. Traumatized by his own violent end, Jason returned to the world unhinged and bent on revenge. Not only for himself, but for everyone caught in the crossfire of the endless catch-and-release cycle of Gotham City's super-villain underworld. He trained himself to be a killer and a mercenary, and he took on a new identity and code name the Red Hood in order to strike his own brand of fear in Gotham's criminals.
            Over time, Jason learned to deal with his rage in a way that didnt rack up a body count and he made peace with Batman and his fellow superheroes. But the bad blood between him and his adoptive family is ever ready to paint their city red once more.</b></p>

            <p class="Black_Widow"><b>Natasha Romanoff was trained from a young age to cultivate a very specific set of skills in a Russian facility called the Red Room. There she honed the skills that would turn her into a human warrior who continues to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with super soldiers, Asgardians and people in armored suits. However, she eventually eschewed her KGB masters, switched allegiances and began working for the good guys.</b></p>
